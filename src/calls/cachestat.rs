/// `cachestat()` returns the page cache statistics of a file in the
/// bytes range specified by `off` and `len`: number of cached pages,
/// number of dirty pages, number of pages marked for writeback,
/// number of evicted pages, and number of recently evicted pages.
///
/// An evicted page is a page that is previously in the page cache
/// but has been evicted since. A page is recently evicted if its last
/// eviction was recent enough that its reentry to the cache would
/// indicate that it is actively being used by the system, and that
/// there is memory pressure on the system.
///
/// `off` and `len` must be non-negative integers. If `len` > 0,
/// the queried range is [`off`, `off` + `len`]. If `len` == 0,
/// we will query in the range from `off` to the end of the file.
///
/// The `flags` argument is unused for now, but is included for future
/// extensibility. User should pass 0 (i.e no flag specified).
///
/// Currently, hugetlbfs is not supported.
///
/// Because the status of a page can change after `cachestat()` checks it
/// but before it returns to the application, the returned values may
/// contain stale information.
///
/// return values:
///   - zero       - success
///   - EFAULT     - cstat or `cstat_range` points to an illegal address
///   - EINVAL     - invalid flags
///   - EBADF      - invalid file descriptor
///   - EOPNOTSUPP - file descriptor is of a hugetlbfs file
